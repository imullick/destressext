This is a cute chrome extension built using HTML/CSS/JS/JSON that displays random pictures of cats and dogs. The user can click on the extension whenever you feel stressed and see these photos to have a short cute break :)

Keep the three files in one folder. Additionally, create a new folder named "assets" inside the main folder and insert pictures in the folder. Don't forget to replace the names of the images in the images list (Line 5 in window.html file)!
